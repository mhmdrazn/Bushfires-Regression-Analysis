# West Australian Weather Analysis with Linear Regression Model

This repository contains a project for analyzing and creating a linear regression model based on the weather data of West Australian suburbs. The data analyzed covers the period from December 2023 to February 2024.

## Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to analyze the weather data from various suburbs in Western Australia and build a linear regression model to predict future weather patterns. The regression model focuses on the relationship between the status of bushfires and two key weather parameters: the speed of maximum wind gust and evaporation.

## Features
- Data collection and preprocessing from December 2023 to February 2024.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand trends and patterns.
- Development of a linear regression model to predict weather parameters.
- Visualization of the analysis and model predictions.

## Data
The weather data for this project covers the period from December 2023 to February 2024. The data includes information on the Date, Suburb, Time, Status, Location, Area, Minimum temperature (°C), Maximum temperature (°C), Rainfall, Evaporation, Sunshine, Direction Max Wind Gust, Speed of maximum wind gust (km/h), Time of maximum wind gust.

## Project Structure
- `Bushfires Dataset` - File to store the suburb and weather data.
- `bushfires_regression.ipynb` - Jupyter notebooks for analysis and modelling.
- `bushfires_regression.pr`- Python code for details.
